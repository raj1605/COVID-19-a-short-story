# COVID-19-a-short-story
This repo belongs to our information visualization project final submission using D3.js. The contributors for this repo is the Tailblazers group (Rutuja Murlidhar Taware, Jignasu Pathak, Monish Raj Raghu and Nidhi Priya).

In this project we aim to explore the COVID-19 data and focus specifically on the state of California to discover more about the covid cases, vaccine efficacies and, the speed of vaccine research and deployment. We present the visualization in the form of a webpage for this project to demonstrate the hidden interesting patterns that occur in the dataset. Our audience are the government officials who can make use of the visually easy-to-understand data format to make important decisions and learn from the processes followed in the past.
